## Introduction

This lab exercise focuses on the implementation of algorithms to fill closed shapes on a 2D plane, primarily using
Pineda's algorithm for triangles and polygons. The tasks involve working with edge functions to determine which points
within a bounding rectangle belong inside a given polygon, particularly convex polygons.

## Tasks

1. **Pineda's Algorithm for Triangles**: Implement the Pineda algorithm to fill triangles.
2. **Pineda's Algorithm for Polygons**: Extend Pineda's algorithm to handle convex polygons.
