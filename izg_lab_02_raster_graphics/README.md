## Introduction

This lab focuses on the rasterization techniques for drawing basic geometric shapes like lines and circles on a 2D
raster grid. You will implement algorithms that are fundamental to computer graphics, such as the Digital Differential
Analyzer (DDA) for lines and the Midpoint Circle Algorithm for circles.

## Tasks

1. **Line Rasterization**: Implement the DDA and Fixed-point DDA algorithms to rasterize lines.
2. **Circle Rasterization**: Implement the Midpoint Circle Algorithm.
