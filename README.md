This repository contains labs for the IZG course. These labs are designed to provide hands-on experience with various
aspects of computer graphics, from basic rasterization techniques and 2D curve manipulation to more complex 3D
transformations and shader programming using GLSL.

## Labs Overview

1. **Lab 01: Color Space Reduction**
   - **Focus:** Techniques for reducing color space, including grayscale conversion and dithering.
   - **Goals:** Implement algorithms to convert images to grayscale and binary formats.
2. **Lab 02: Generation of Basic Objects in Raster Graphics**
   - **Focus:** Rasterization of basic geometric shapes.
   - **Goals:** Implement line and circle rasterization algorithms.
3. **Lab 03: Filling Closed 2D Objects**
   - **Focus:** Algorithms to fill closed shapes on a 2D plane.
   - **Goals:** Implement filling algorithms for triangles and polygons using edge functions.
4. **Lab 04: 3D Transformations**
   - **Focus:** Basic 3D transformations using the OpenSceneGraph toolkit.
   - **Goals:** Implement translation, scaling, and rotation transformations.
5. **Lab 05: Displaying 2D Curves**
   - **Focus:** Calculation and display of 2D curves, specifically Bezier curves.
   - **Goals:** Compute trajectories using Bezier cubic curves and ensure G1 continuity between curve segments.
6. **Lab 06: Shader Labs**
    - **Focus:** Use of GLSL for shader programming in graphics rendering.
    - **Goals:** Create various graphical effects and animations using vertex and fragment shaders.
